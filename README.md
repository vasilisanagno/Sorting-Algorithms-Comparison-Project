# Sorting Algorithms Comparison Project

## Description
This project implements various modern variations of the Quicksort algorithm and compares their performance in sorting arrays of integers stored in the main memory.

### Quicksort Variations
- **Quicksort_1p_l (QS1pL):** Classic Quicksort with the leftmost element as the pivot.
- **Quicksort_1p_r (QS1pR):** Quicksort with a randomly selected pivot.
- **Quicksort_1p_m (QS1pM):** Quicksort with the median of three randomly selected pivots.
- **Quicksort_2p_r (QS2pR):** Quicksort with two randomly selected pivots.
- **Quicksort_3p_r (QS3pR):** Quicksort with three randomly selected pivots.
- **Quicksort_2p_r_pre (QS2pRPre):** Modified QS2pR with pre-selected square root of n pivots.
- **Quicksort_3p_r_pre (QS3pRPre):** Modified QS3pR with pre-selected square root of n pivots.

## Results and Analysis
